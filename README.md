# Shuttle!

Welcome to Shuttle! 

This is my attempt at creating a social media app/website by using the React framework, and also using Firebase/store as a nosql cloud backend.

It was a huge challenge to take after only being exposed to Firebase's real time database, constantly referring to the firestore documentation and following a few tutorials I was able to create Shuttle!

On Shuttle! Users will be able to register with email addresses and passwords, post individual shuttles, users will then be also able to comment, like and unlike shuttles they find. Notifications are also present in Shuttle! Incase someone likes your post.

Quite Nifty!
